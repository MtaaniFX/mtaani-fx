this script is meant to register the URL endpoints for confirmation and validation
when a transaction occurs. a transaction here is c2b or stkpush.

this script in production should only be ran once since safaricom expects the two 
urls to be registered only once.

i am writing it in its own file to make it easier to modify and run
